### Motivation and Related Work

This project was inspired by the USDA's Economic Research Service website, which highlights the long-term decline in fluid milk consumption in the U.S. over 70 years. It discusses generational shifts in dietary habits and the limited impact of plant-based alternatives on this trend. Despite government programs like the National School Lunch Program and marketing efforts, reversing the decline has been challenging. This information provided context for analyzing milk consumption patterns and their societal implications. The USDA's Economic Research Service reports that U.S. per capita fluid milk consumption has been declining for over 70 years, with the steepest drop in the 2010s. Between 2003 and 2018, individuals across all age groups reduced their milk intake, primarily consumed as a beverage. While plant-based milk alternatives have gained popularity, they account for only a small portion of this decline. The decrease is largely attributed to generational shifts in dietary habits, with newer generations consuming less milk than their predecessors. Despite efforts by government programs and the dairy industry to promote milk consumption, such as the National School Lunch Program and various marketing initiatives, reversing this downward trend has proven challenging.

### Initial questions
<br>
<ul>
<li> How has milk <b>production varied across different states and years</b>? </li>
<li> How many milking <b>cows are there in different regions of the US</b>, does more milk production mean more milking cows? </li>
<li> How do different types of milk (e.g., whole, skim, etc.) <b>compare</b> in terms of <b>sales</b>? </li>
<li> What have been the <b>trends for flavored milk?</b> </li>
<li> What are the <b>current trends in consumer preferences</b> for different types of milk? </li>
<li> How do <b>nutritional components differ</b> for different types of milk? </li>
<li> Can we comment on <b>health consciousness</b> of people as a whole based on the sales of the different milk types? </li>
</ul>
<br><br>

### Data

<br><br>

### Exploratory analysis

In the project, we used visualizations like line plots, bar plots, and histograms to analyze trends in fluid milk sales over time. These helped us compare different milk types, flavored vs. non-flavored categories, and overall sales trends by decade. Summaries provided key insights, like the steady decline in milk sales after 2010 and generational shifts in consumption. We used exploratory statistical analyses to calculate means, group sales by decade, and compare trends across milk types. These steps were essential to highlight patterns and changes in consumer behavior. Initially, the focus was broader, but we narrowed it to trends like flavored vs. non-flavored milk and decade-wise changes for clearer insights. This shift allowed us to align the project better with the dataset's strengths and the observed trends.

### Data analysis

In this project, several statistical tests were conducted to analyze milk sales patterns. An ANOVA test was performed on sales ratios of different milk types (Whole, Reduced Fat 2%, Low Fat 1%, Skim) to determine if there were significant differences in their rates of change. The test revealed a p-value of 0.0432, which is below 0.05, indicating that at least one milk type showed a significantly different sales trend compared to others. This supports the idea that consumer preferences for milk types vary significantly. A paired t-test compared the year-over-year sales ratios of Flavored Whole Milk versus Non-Whole Milk. The test yielded a p-value of 0.1778, greater than 0.05, suggesting no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The confidence interval for the mean difference included 0, further confirming that the difference in sales ratios was not significant. These tests provided quantitative support to understand trends in milk sales and highlighted how statistical analysis can identify patterns and validate insights.

### Discussion

From the project, we found that fluid milk sales have steadily declined since 2010, with a significant drop in recent decades. Whole milk sales have decreased over time, while reduced-fat and skim milk gained popularity earlier but also declined after 2010. Flavored non-whole milk consistently had higher sales than flavored whole milk.
These findings align with expectations based on broader consumer shifts toward plant-based alternatives and reduced dairy consumption. Insights include the impact of generational habits, health trends, and competition from alternative beverages. What’s more, some people may believe that the appearance of  COVID-19 could also be a factor. During the pandemic, there was an initial spike in grocery purchases, including milk, as people stayed home and cooked more. However, this was temporary and may not have reversed the long-term downward trend in fluid milk consumption. School closures and reduced institutional demand could also have negatively impacted sales. Overall, while COVID-19 may have caused short-term fluctuations, it’s unlikely to be a key factor in the long-term decline observed in the dataset. All in all, the data highlights the dairy industry's challenges in maintaining relevance amid changing preferences.
