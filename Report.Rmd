### Motivation

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the dairy industry, focusing on trends in milk production, consumer preferences, and the nutritional content of various milk types. By examining U.S. milk production and cow numbers from 1970 to 2023, it aims to uncover regional disparities and shifts in production patterns over time. The project also explores consumer preferences for whole milk, 2%, 1%, and skim, investigating the factors driving changes in demand. Additionally, it compares the nutritional profiles of these milk types, with a focus on cholesterol, fat, and mineral content, to offer insights into the health implications of different milk choices.

<br>

### Related Work

Research on the U.S. dairy industry has examined trends in milk production, consumer preferences, and nutritional content. The USDAâ€™s Economic Research Service (ERS) reports a 70-year decline in fluid milk consumption, driven largely by generational shifts in dietary habits rather than the rise of plant-based alternatives [1]. While milk production has increased due to advances in farming practices, the number of dairy cows has decreased, creating regional disparities in output [3]. Consumer preferences have shifted toward reduced-fat milks due to health concerns [2]. This body of research offers valuable context for understanding the complex dynamics of milk production, consumption, and health.

<br>

### Initial questions

Initially, we were mainly interested in answering these questions:
<ol>
 <li><b>How has milk production varied across different states and years?</b>
     <ul>
         <li>We aimed to understand the regional patterns in milk production across the United States.</li>
     </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>How many milking cows are there in different regions of the US, and does more milk production mean more milking cows?</b>
     <ul>
         <li>We wished to explore the relationship between the number of milking cows and the volume of milk production in different regions.</li>
     </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>How do different types of milk (e.g., whole, skim, etc.) compare in terms of sales?</b>
     <ul>
         <li>We sought to compare sales figures for various types of milk to understand market trends..</li>
     </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
<br>
<b>As our project progressed, our initial questions evolved and expanded in scope</b>: We grew particularly interested in exploring the regional differences that have emerged over the years in milking cow populations and milk production across the US. Additionally, our focus on different types of milk broadened to include an analysis of flavored milk varieties.

<br>
Apart from this, we also became interested in the nutritional side of the types of Milk and had additional questions.
<ol>
 <li><b>How do nutritional components differ for different types of milk?</b>
     <ul>
         <li> It is common knowledge that fat differs across Whole, 2%, 1% and Skim milk- but what about other nutrients? We decided to analyse this.</li>
     </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>Can we comment on the health consciousness of people as a whole based on the sales of the different milk types?</b>
     <ul>
         <li>Seeing the differences, we became interested in if sales are driven by the nutrients in the different types of milk. This was a long shot as it would be hard to answer this question just based on limited information.</li>
     </ul>
 </li>
</ol>

### Data

Milk Types Sales Data: The cleaning process begins by reading the dataset from an Excel file using the read_excel() function. The column names are renamed to more descriptive and consistent labels, making them easier to interpret. Next, the `Year` column is converted to a numeric data type to ensure compatibility with numerical operations. Any rows with missing values in the Year column are removed to maintain data integrity. Following this, the columns representing milk sales are also converted to numeric values, ensuring uniformity in data types across these variables. Finally, the cleaned dataset is printed for review, and ready for further analysis.

Milk Cows and Milk Production Data: The tidying process for these datasets begins by reading data from two sheets of an Excel file using the `read_excel()` function. The `x` characters in the column names of the years are removed using the `gsub()` function, and the columns are then converted to numeric format. A `Region` column is added to the dataset for regional identification. The `pivot_longer()` function is applied to reshape the data, creating Year, milk_cows, and milk_production columns. The datasets are then merged using the `inner_join()` function. The resulting code is saved in the scripts folder and loaded into the analysis RMD files using the `source()` function.

### Exploratory analysis

<b>Milk Types:</b>In the project, we used visualizations like line plots, bar plots, and histograms to analyze trends in fluid milk sales over time. These helped us compare different milk types, flavored vs. non-flavored categories, and overall sales trends by decade. Summaries provided key insights, like the steady decline in milk sales after 2010 and generational shifts in consumption. We used exploratory statistical analyses to calculate means, group sales by decade, and compare trends across milk types. These steps were essential to highlight patterns and changes in consumer behavior. Initially, the focus was broader, but we narrowed it to trends like flavored vs. non-flavored milk and decade-wise changes for clearer insights. This shift allowed us to align the project better with the dataset's strengths and the observed trends.

This plot shows the total fluid milk sales (in million pounds) over time, indicating a steady decline since the early 2000s.

The plots  illustrate the overall trend in the total number of milk cows from 1970 to 2023. The data shows a shift in production, with some states experiencing a significant increase in milk cow numbers, while others have seen a decline. States like New Mexico, Idaho, Arizona, and Colorado have experienced more than a 100% increase in milk cow production. In contrast, states like Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and New Jersey have seen a near-total decline in their milk cow industries.

Similarly, milk cow production is analyzed by region. As observed in the he U.S. map distribution, the data shows the top regions in total milk cows in 1970 vs 2023. In 1970, the Lake States, with 3,196 thousand milk cows, were the leading region, followed by other key regions such as the Northeast, Corn Belt, Appalachia, and West Coast. By 2023, the Mountain region had emerged as one of the top regions in milk cow production. Overall, the data reveals significant regional shifts in milk cow production from 1970 to 2023, reflecting changing trends over time.

### Data analysis

<b>Milk Types:</b>In this project, several statistical tests were conducted to analyze milk sales patterns. An ANOVA test was performed on sales ratios of different milk types (Whole, Reduced Fat 2%, Low Fat 1%, Skim) to determine if there were significant differences in their rates of change. The test revealed a p-value of 0.0432, which is below 0.05, indicating that at least one milk type showed a significantly different sales trend compared to others. This supports the idea that consumer preferences for milk types vary significantly. A paired t-test compared the year-over-year sales ratios of Flavored Whole Milk versus Non-Whole Milk. The test yielded a p-value of 0.1778, greater than 0.05, suggesting no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The confidence interval for the mean difference included 0, further confirming that the difference in sales ratios was not significant. These tests provided quantitative support to understand trends in milk sales and highlighted how statistical analysis can identify patterns and validate insights.

<b>Milk Cows:</b>The linear regression model, using Alabama as the reference category, reveals state-year interactions (e.g., California:year = 25.73, p < 0.001; New Mexico:year = 9.48, p < 0.001) suggest that some states, like California and New Mexico, have seen increases in production over time, while others have experienced declines. The year variable indicates a general decline in milk cow numbers across all states over time (estimate = -1.983, p < 0.001).
The linear regression model for milk cow production by region and year reveals that Significant State-Year interactions (e.g., Mountain Region:year 6.36, p < 0.001; West Coast:year 12.00, p < 0.001) suggest that some regions, like California, have seen increases in milk cow production, while regions like the Lake States (estimate = -5.584, p < 0.001) have seen declines. The year variable has a significant negative effect on milk cow numbers (-3.24, p < 0.001), indicating a general decline in milk cow populations across all regions over time. 

<b>Milk Production:</b>The results of the linear regression model for milk cow production by state and year are provided below. The state-year interaction results show how milk production (in million pounds) trends differ across states over time. For example, California exhibits substantial positive growth in milk production, with an interaction coefficient of 767.01 million pounds per year (p < 0.001), suggesting significant annual increases in production. Similarly, Texas (229.81 million pounds/year) and New Mexico (208.66 million pounds/year) also show notable increases over time. In contrast, states like Tennessee (-23.16 million pounds/year) experience declines in milk production, indicating a regional decrease in dairy production. The year variable itself has a negative coefficient of -15.24 million pounds (p = 0.009), suggesting an overall decline in milk production across all states over time, though this trend is not uniform. 
The linear regression model results for milk production by region and year, with Appalachia as the reference region, are given below. While the year variable itself has a non-significant effect on milk production across all regions (estimate = -20.576, p = 0.237), significant region-year interactions indicate that some regions have seen increases in milk production over time. Notably, the Lake States (estimate = 130.39, p < 0.001), Mountain Region (estimate = 114.22, p < 0.001), and West Coast (estimate = 314.34, p < 0.001) have experienced positive trends in milk production over time, showing significant growth.

<b>Nutrition: </b> Our nutrition-based analysis looked into the nutritional profiles of whole, 2%, 1%, and skim milk, both individually and in relation to their sales ratios over a year, to understand consumer preferences and trends. We found significant differences in calories, calcium, sodium, and cholesterol among these types, with whole milk having the highest fat content and skim milk the least. We wanted to see if health consciousness was influencing milk sales, but the results werenâ€™t clear-cut. We found a slight positive trend between cholesterol content and sales ratios, but it wasnâ€™t statistically significant. Likewise, higher saturated fat content showed a negative trend with sales, but this also wasnâ€™t significant. Interestingly, our model overestimated sales for 2% and skim milk while underestimating for whole and 1% milk. Our findings suggest that other unaccounted factors are also playing a role. To get a clearer picture, we need a more detailed model.

### Discussion

From the project, we found that fluid milk sales have steadily declined since 2010, with a significant drop in recent decades. Whole milk sales have decreased over time, while reduced-fat and skim milk gained popularity earlier but also declined after 2010. Flavored non-whole milk consistently had higher sales than flavored whole milk.
These findings align with expectations based on broader consumer shifts toward plant-based alternatives and reduced dairy consumption. Insights include the impact of generational habits, health trends, and competition from alternative beverages. Whatâ€™s more, some people may believe that the appearance of  COVID-19 could also be a factor. During the pandemic, there was an initial spike in grocery purchases, including milk, as people stayed home and cooked more. However, this was temporary and may not have reversed the long-term downward trend in fluid milk consumption. School closures and reduced institutional demand could also have negatively impacted sales. Overall, while COVID-19 may have caused short-term fluctuations, itâ€™s unlikely to be a key factor in the long-term decline observed in the dataset. All in all, the data highlights the dairy industry's challenges in maintaining relevance amid changing preferences.

Between 1970 and 2023, U.S. milk cow production and milk production have undergone significant regional shifts. In 1970, Wisconsin led in both milk cow numbers and production, but by 2023, California surpassed it. States like Idaho, New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado have seen more than 100% increases in milk cow numbers and production, while states like Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and New Jersey have experienced substantial declines. Regionally, the Lake States, Northeast, and Corn Belt, which were dominant in 1970, saw decreases, while the Mountain and West Coast regions emerged as major producers. These trends reflect a broader redistribution of milk cow and milk production across the U.S. over the past five decades.

Our nutritional analysis revealed significant differences in calories, calcium, sodium, and cholesterol among whole, 2%, 1%, and skim milk. These variations underscore the diverse health impacts and preferences influencing consumer choices. Understanding these nutritional factors is crucial in determining how they drive milk consumption trends. We also explored whether this nutritional information could predict sales trends and suggest a growing health consciousness among consumers.

<br><br>

### Limitations
<ul>
<li><b>Tastes and Dietary Requirements</b>:
To get a clearer picture of health impacts, we need to understand people's dietary needs and preferences better. Taste and how people use different types of milk are really important too. Just looking at cholesterol and fat isn't enough to tell the whole story. We also need to consider dietary requirements and other associated factors.
</li>
<li><b>Limited Categories for Flavoured Milk Data</b>:
Our analysis of flavored milk was pretty limitedâ€”we only looked at flavoured whole milk and flavoured non-whole milk. Because of this, we can't make broad conclusions. With so many flavours and brands out there, each with different prices, nutrients, and other factors, our findings are just a starting point.
</li>
<li><b>Economic and Political Factors Unaccounted For</b>:
Regional trends in milk production and consumption are influenced by a lot of different factors, such as policies. Without looking at regional policies, market conditions, and environmental regulations, it's tough to fully understand why production or consumption might be going up or down. These factors add a lot of complexity and might hide the true reasons behind the trends we see.
</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

### Further Scope

Our analysis lays a strong foundation for an even more detailed report. The regional analysis reveals various trends and historical differences that could be much clearer with the inclusion of economic factors and relevant policies. Beyond just sales data, understanding how consumers use milk can offer valuable insights. For instance, is 1% Milk usually consumed directly, while Whole Milk is reserved for baking? Adding variables through surveys or other methods to answer questions like, "Are people buying milk for protein or other nutrients? Are they unaware of the differences between milk types, or is it simply a matter of taste?" could reveal whether an increase in health consciousness is driving sales up or down for the different types.
