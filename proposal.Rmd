## Project title:
Analysis of Milk Production and Consumption Patterns in the United States

## Motivation:

Understanding state-wise milk production and the consumption of whole, low-fat, and skimmed milk is crucial for optimizing supply chains, ensuring food security, and supporting sustainable agriculture. Using USDA data, our project aims to analyze these trends and provide insights for policymakers, dairy farmers, and businesses. Additionally, our project seeks to study consumer behaviour in choosing the type of milk they prefer to drink. 

## Planned Timeline

```{r echo = FALSE}
weeks <- c("November 11-15", "November 18-22", "November 25-29", "December 2-6", 
"December 7")
goals <- c("Project Review Meeting", "Data tidying", "Data Analysis", "Website build", "Project Submission")
df <- data.frame(Weeks = weeks, Tasks = goals)
# Display the table using kable
knitr::kable(df)
```
