<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the dairy industry,
focusing on trends in milk production, consumer preferences, and the
nutritional content of various milk types. By examining U.S. milk
production and cow numbers from 1970 to 2023, it aims to uncover
regional disparities and shifts in production patterns over time. The
project also explores consumer preferences for whole milk, 2%, 1%, and
skim, investigating the factors driving changes in demand. Additionally,
it compares the nutritional profiles of these milk types, with a focus
on cholesterol, fat, and mineral content, to offer insights into the
health implications of different milk choices.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Related Work</h3>
<p>Research on the U.S. dairy industry has examined trends in milk
production, consumer preferences, and nutritional content. The USDA’s
Economic Research Service (ERS) reports a 70-year decline in fluid milk
consumption, driven largely by generational shifts in dietary habits
rather than the rise of plant-based alternatives [1]. While milk
production has increased due to advances in farming practices, the
number of dairy cows has decreased, creating regional disparities in
output [3]. Consumer preferences have shifted toward reduced-fat milks
due to health concerns [2]. This body of research offers valuable
context for understanding the complex dynamics of milk production,
consumption, and health.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Initial questions</h3>
Initially, we were mainly interested in answering these questions:
<ol>
<li>
<b>How has milk production varied across different states and years?</b>
<ul>
<li>
We aimed to understand the regional patterns in milk production across
the United States.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>How many milking cows are there in different regions of the US, and
does more milk production mean more milking cows?</b>
<ul>
<li>
We wished to explore the relationship between the number of milking cows
and the volume of milk production in different regions.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>How do different types of milk (e.g., whole, skim, etc.) compare in
terms of sales?</b>
<ul>
<li>
We sought to compare sales figures for various types of milk to
understand market trends..
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br> <b>As our project progressed, our initial questions evolved and
expanded in scope</b>: We grew particularly interested in exploring the
regional differences that have emerged over the years in milking cow
populations and milk production across the US. Additionally, our focus
on different types of milk broadened to include an analysis of flavored
milk varieties.</p>
<br> Apart from this, we also became interested in the nutritional side
of the types of Milk and had additional questions.
<ol>
<li>
<b>How do nutritional components differ for different types of milk?</b>
<ul>
<li>
It is common knowledge that fat differs across Whole, 2%, 1% and Skim
milk- but what about other nutrients? We decided to analyse this.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Can we comment on the health consciousness of people as a whole based
on the sales of the different milk types?</b>
<ul>
<li>
Seeing the differences, we became interested in if sales are driven by
the nutrients in the different types of milk. This was a long shot as it
would be hard to answer this question just based on limited information.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Milk Types Sales Data: The cleaning process begins by reading the
dataset from an Excel file using the read_excel() function. The column
names are renamed to more descriptive and consistent labels, making them
easier to interpret. Next, the <code>Year</code> column is converted to
a numeric data type to ensure compatibility with numerical operations.
Any rows with missing values in the Year column are removed to maintain
data integrity. Following this, the columns representing milk sales are
also converted to numeric values, ensuring uniformity in data types
across these variables. Finally, the cleaned dataset is printed for
review, and ready for further analysis.</p>
<p>Milk Cows and Milk Production Data: The tidying process for these
datasets begins by reading data from two sheets of an Excel file using
the <code>read_excel()</code> function. The <code>x</code> characters in
the column names of the years are removed using the <code>gsub()</code>
function, and the columns are then converted to numeric format. A
<code>Region</code> column is added to the dataset for regional
identification. The <code>pivot_longer()</code> function is applied to
reshape the data, creating Year, milk_cows, and milk_production columns.
The datasets are then merged using the <code>inner_join()</code>
function. The resulting code is saved in the scripts folder and loaded
into the analysis RMD files using the <code>source()</code>
function.</p>

<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploratory analysis</h3>
<p><b>Milk Types:</b>In the project, we used visualizations like line
plots, bar plots, and histograms to analyze trends in fluid milk sales
over time. These helped us compare different milk types, flavored
vs. non-flavored categories, and overall sales trends by decade.
Summaries provided key insights, like the steady decline in milk sales
after 2010 and generational shifts in consumption. We used exploratory
statistical analyses to calculate means, group sales by decade, and
compare trends across milk types. These steps were essential to
highlight patterns and changes in consumer behavior. Initially, the
focus was broader, but we narrowed it to trends like flavored
vs. non-flavored milk and decade-wise changes for clearer insights. This
shift allowed us to align the project better with the dataset’s
strengths and the observed trends.</p>

<p><b>Milk Cows:</b> The U.S. maps below the distribution of milk cows
in 1970 vs 2023. While Wisconsin was the leading state in 1970,
California surpassed it by 2023. Additionally, states like Idaho, which
did not play a major role in milk production in 1970, have now become
one of the leading producers.</p>

<p><img src="milk_cows_files/figure-html
/unnamed-chunk-8-2.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The plots illustrate the overall trend in the total number of milk
cows from 1970 to 2023. The data shows a shift in production, with some
states experiencing a significant increase in milk cow numbers, while
others have seen a decline. States like New Mexico, Idaho, Arizona, and
Colorado have experienced more than a 100% increase in milk cow
production. In contrast, states like Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
and New Jersey have seen a near-total decline in their milk cow
industries.</p>

<p><img src="milk_cows_files/figure-html
/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Similarly, milk cow production is analyzed by region. As observed in
the he U.S. map distribution, the data shows the top regions in total
milk cows in 1970 vs 2023. In 1970, the Lake States, with 3,196 thousand
milk cows, were the leading region, followed by other key regions such
as the Northeast, Corn Belt, Appalachia, and West Coast. By 2023, the
Mountain region had emerged as one of the top regions in milk cow
production. Overall, the data reveals significant regional shifts in
milk cow production from 1970 to 2023, reflecting changing trends over
time.</p>
<p><img src="milk_cows_files/figure-html

<p><img src="milk_cows_files/figure-html
/unnamed-chunk-11-4.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The following plots shows the overall trend in regional milk cow
production from 1970 to 2023. Milk cow production in the Lake States,
Northeast, Corn Belt, and Appalachia has decreased over time. In
contrast, milk cow production in the West Coast, Mountain Region, and
Southern Plains has increased, highlighting the regional shifts in milk
cow production over the past few decades.</p>

<p><b>Milk Production:</b>The U.S. map distribution below shows the top
states in milk production in 1970 versus 2023. A shift in regional milk
production between 1970 and 2023. While Wisconsin was the leading state
in 1970, California surpassed it by 2023. Additionally, states like
Idaho, which played a minor role in milk production in 1970, have now
become major producers.</p>

<p><img src="milk_production_files/figure-html
/state-2023.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The plots below illustrate the overall trend in the milk production
from 1970 to 2023. The data shows a shift in production, with some
states experiencing a significant increase in milk production, while
others have seen a decline. States like New Mexico, Idaho, Arizona, and
Colorado have experienced more than a 100% increase in milk production.
In contrast, states like Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and New Jersey
have seen a near-total decline in their milk production.

<p>Similarly, milk production is analyzed by region. As in the US map
distribution, and the line plots, the data shows the top regions in milk
produciton in 1970 vs 2023. in 1970, Lake States, Appalachia, Northeast
were among the leading producers of milk. By 2023, the West Coast and
Mountain region had emerged as one of the top regions in milk cow
production. Overall, the data reveals significant regional shifts in
milk production from 1970 to 2023, reflecting changing trends over
time.</p>

<p>The following plot shows the overall trend in regional milk
production from 1970 to 2023. Milk production has increased over the
years in most regions, including the Lake States, West Coast, and
Mountain Region.</p>

<h3>Data analysis</h3>
<p><b>Milk Types:</b>In this project, several statistical tests were
conducted to analyze milk sales patterns. An ANOVA test was performed on
sales ratios of different milk types (Whole, Reduced Fat 2%, Low Fat 1%,
Skim) to determine if there were significant differences in their rates
of change. The test revealed a p-value of 0.0432, which is below 0.05,
indicating that at least one milk type showed a significantly different
sales trend compared to others. This supports the idea that consumer
preferences for milk types vary significantly. A paired t-test compared
the year-over-year sales ratios of Flavored Whole Milk versus Non-Whole
Milk. The test yielded a p-value of 0.1778, greater than 0.05,
suggesting no statistically significant difference between the two
groups. The confidence interval for the mean difference included 0,
further confirming that the difference in sales ratios was not
significant. These tests provided quantitative support to understand
trends in milk sales and highlighted how statistical analysis can
identify patterns and validate insights.</p>
<p><b>Milk Cows:</b>The linear regression model, using Alabama as the
reference category, reveals state-year interactions (e.g.,
California:year = 25.73, p &lt; 0.001; New Mexico:year = 9.48, p &lt;
0.001) suggest that some states, like California and New Mexico, have
seen increases in production over time, while others have experienced
declines. The year variable indicates a general decline in milk cow
numbers across all states over time (estimate = -1.983, p &lt; 0.001).
The linear regression model for milk cow production by region and year
reveals that Significant State-Year interactions (e.g., Mountain
Region:year 6.36, p &lt; 0.001; West Coast:year 12.00, p &lt; 0.001)
suggest that some regions, like California, have seen increases in milk
cow production, while regions like the Lake States (estimate = -5.584, p
&lt; 0.001) have seen declines. The year variable has a significant
negative effect on milk cow numbers (-3.24, p &lt; 0.001), indicating a
general decline in milk cow populations across all regions over
time.</p>
<p><b>Milk Production:</b>The results of the linear regression model for
milk cow production by state and year are provided below. The state-year
interaction results show how milk production (in million pounds) trends
differ across states over time. For example, California exhibits
substantial positive growth in milk production, with an interaction
coefficient of 767.01 million pounds per year (p &lt; 0.001), suggesting
significant annual increases in production. Similarly, Texas (229.81
million pounds/year) and New Mexico (208.66 million pounds/year) also
show notable increases over time. In contrast, states like Tennessee
(-23.16 million pounds/year) experience declines in milk production,
indicating a regional decrease in dairy production. The year variable
itself has a negative coefficient of -15.24 million pounds (p = 0.009),
suggesting an overall decline in milk production across all states over
time, though this trend is not uniform. The linear regression model
results for milk production by region and year, with Appalachia as the
reference region, are given below. While the year variable itself has a
non-significant effect on milk production across all regions (estimate =
-20.576, p = 0.237), significant region-year interactions indicate that
some regions have seen increases in milk production over time. Notably,
the Lake States (estimate = 130.39, p &lt; 0.001), Mountain Region
(estimate = 114.22, p &lt; 0.001), and West Coast (estimate = 314.34, p
&lt; 0.001) have experienced positive trends in milk production over
time, showing significant growth.</p>
<p><b>Nutrition: </b> Our nutrition-based analysis looked into the
nutritional profiles of whole, 2%, 1%, and skim milk, both individually
and in relation to their sales ratios over a year, to understand
consumer preferences and trends. We found significant differences in
calories, calcium, sodium, and cholesterol among these types, with whole
milk having the highest fat content and skim milk the least. We wanted
to see if health consciousness was influencing milk sales, but the
results weren’t clear-cut. We found a slight positive trend between
cholesterol content and sales ratios, but it wasn’t statistically
significant. Likewise, higher saturated fat content showed a negative
trend with sales, but this also wasn’t significant. Interestingly, our
model overestimated sales for 2% and skim milk while underestimating for
whole and 1% milk. Our findings suggest that other unaccounted factors
are also playing a role. To get a clearer picture, we need a more
detailed model.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>From the project, we found that fluid milk sales have steadily
declined since 2010, with a significant drop in recent decades. Whole
milk sales have decreased over time, while reduced-fat and skim milk
gained popularity earlier but also declined after 2010. Flavored
non-whole milk consistently had higher sales than flavored whole milk.
These findings align with expectations based on broader consumer shifts
toward plant-based alternatives and reduced dairy consumption. Insights
include the impact of generational habits, health trends, and
competition from alternative beverages. What’s more, some people may
believe that the appearance of COVID-19 could also be a factor. During
the pandemic, there was an initial spike in grocery purchases, including
milk, as people stayed home and cooked more. However, this was temporary
and may not have reversed the long-term downward trend in fluid milk
consumption. School closures and reduced institutional demand could also
have negatively impacted sales. Overall, while COVID-19 may have caused
short-term fluctuations, it’s unlikely to be a key factor in the
long-term decline observed in the dataset. All in all, the data
highlights the dairy industry’s challenges in maintaining relevance amid
changing preferences.</p>
<p>Between 1970 and 2023, U.S. milk cow production and milk production
have undergone significant regional shifts. In 1970, Wisconsin led in
both milk cow numbers and production, but by 2023, California surpassed
it. States like Idaho, New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado have seen more
than 100% increases in milk cow numbers and production, while states
like Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and New Jersey have experienced
substantial declines. Regionally, the Lake States, Northeast, and Corn
Belt, which were dominant in 1970, saw decreases, while the Mountain and
West Coast regions emerged as major producers. These trends reflect a
broader redistribution of milk cow and milk production across the U.S.
over the past five decades.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Tastes and Dietary Requirements</b>: To get a clearer picture of
health impacts, we need to understand people’s dietary needs and
preferences better. Taste and how people use different types of milk are
really important too. Just looking at cholesterol and fat isn’t enough
to tell the whole story. We also need to consider dietary requirements
and other associated factors.
</li>
<li>
<b>Limited Categories for Flavoured Milk Data</b>: Our analysis of
flavored milk was pretty limited—we only looked at flavoured whole milk
and flavoured non-whole milk. Because of this, we can’t make broad
conclusions. With so many flavours and brands out there, each with
different prices, nutrients, and other factors, our findings are just a
starting point.
</li>
<li>
<b>Economic and Political Factors Unaccounted For</b>: Regional trends
in milk production and consumption are influenced by a lot of different
factors, such as policies. Without looking at regional policies, market
conditions, and environmental regulations, it’s tough to fully
understand why production or consumption might be going up or down.
These factors add a lot of complexity and might hide the true reasons
behind the trends we see.
</li>
</ul>

<div id="further-scope" class="section level3">
<h3>Further Scope</h3>
<p>Our analysis lays a strong foundation for an even more detailed
report. The regional analysis reveals various trends and historical
differences that could be much clearer with the inclusion of economic
factors and relevant policies. Beyond just sales data, understanding how
consumers use milk can offer valuable insights. For instance, is 1% Milk
usually consumed directly, while Whole Milk is reserved for baking?
Adding variables through surveys or other methods to answer questions
like, “Are people buying milk for protein or other nutrients? Are they
unaware of the differences between milk types, or is it simply a matter
of taste?” could reveal whether an increase in health consciousness is
driving sales up or down for the different types.</p>

<h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
<p>As we conclude our exploration of milk production and consumption, we
extend heartfelt thanks to Professor Jeff Goldsmith for his invaluable
guidance. Analyzing industries has traditionally been the domain of
large organizations and researchers, but our confidence in conducting
this analysis comes from the data science skills we’ve gained. We hope
our research inspires and assists others in understanding and improving
this industry.</p>
