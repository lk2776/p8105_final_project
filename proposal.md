## Project title:

Analysis of Milk Consumption Patterns in the United States

## Motivation:

Understanding state-wise milk production and the consumption of whole,
low-fat, and skimmed milk is crucial for optimizing supply chains,
ensuring food security, and supporting sustainable agriculture. Using
USDA data, our project aims to analyze these trends and provide insights
for policymakers, dairy farmers, and businesses. Additionally, our
project seeks to study consumer behaviour in choosing the type of milk
they prefer to drink.
