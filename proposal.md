## Project Title:

Analysis of Milk Production and Consumption Patterns in the United
States

## Motivation:

Understanding state-wise milk production and the consumption of whole,
low-fat, and skimmed milk is crucial for optimizing supply chains,
ensuring food security, and supporting sustainable agriculture. Using
USDA data, our project aims to analyze these trends and provide insights
for policymakers, dairy farmers, and businesses. Additionally, our
project seeks to study consumer behaviour in choosing the type of milk
they prefer to drink.

## Anticipated Data Sources

- Data for milk sales quantities by product
  (<https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/dairy-data> - Fluid beverage
  milk sales quantities by product (Annual))/

- Data for region subtotals for milk cows, milk per cow, and milk
  production. (<https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/dairy-data> -
  Milk cows and production by State and region (Annual))
